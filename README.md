# Gatsby starter with Ant Design

It's a clone of the default gatsby starter but utilizing ant design (antd) components.

Also feautruring a much cooler header and footer!

## Demo

Check it out [here](https://gatsby-antd-starter.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

Install this starter by running

   ```bash
   gatsby new my_site https://github.com/alienCY/gatsby-antd-starter
   ```
   A full list of ant design components can be found [here](https://ant.design/components/button/)
   
   Highly recomended to import the components as said in their site from `antd`.
   
   For example:
   
   ```javascript
   import { Button, Tooltip } from 'antd';
   import { SearchOutlined } from '@ant-design/icons';
   ```
   
## Extra plugins used

* gatsby-plugin-antd (and antd)

* emotion    (may be removed with some editing in `container.js`)

> * typography (to be removed)
